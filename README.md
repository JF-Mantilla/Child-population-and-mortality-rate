Chart made by me taken from UNICEF open data

This graph provides an approximation of the distribution of the world population of children under 5 years of age in 2021. The first places correspond to India, China and Nigeria, mostly Asian and African countries.

On the other hand, the mortality rate of children under 5 years of age in these countries can be represented by the color of the bar, noting that the countries in the ranking from the African continent are the ones with the most intense color.

Therefore, by making a deduction from the graph it can be seen that underdeveloped countries that lack a good health system, coupled with the poverty they suffer and access to education (sex education) have a higher mortality rate in children under 5 years compared to more developed countries such as China, USA, Brazil and even India.


Course: Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python 

Describe what makes a good or bad visualization, Understand best practices for creating basic charts, Identify the functions that are best for particular problems, Create a visualization using matplotlb

Skills: Python Programming, Data Visualization, Matplotlib

Final Assignment: Personal Project: What is the relationship between the mortality rate of children under 5 years of age in the 5 countries with the highest populations in the world? I needed to search two databases and propose a question that could be answered through a visualization. This visualization was to follow the best practices seen throughout the course. It was decided to work with Unicef databases in order to answer the question. The results could be reviewed through its folder.
